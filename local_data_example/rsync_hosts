NOTES:
-This file is accessed by backup_all.sh.
-The script will stop reading when it reaches the line "end".
-The format for each line is tool name, Windows username on the tool computer,
 IP address (typically for the router that the tool is using), port #, path of the 
 directory to back up (an absolute path that Cygwin can read), the Badger
 name of the tool (currently not used for anything), and a file containing 
 patterns for which matching files will be excluded (this can be omitted).
 Since sometimes a whole drive is backed up, Windows recycle bins and drive
 volume information are always excluded.
